generate a json file similar with the flow.json file above for me using this logic I provided here 
Note1: if multiple choices in the same level, use multiple choice
Note2: every node's name should start with number after the flow_, for example, if I want you to create a flow for flow_6handTremor.json, I want all the node to start with the number 6
Note3: I don't need the find_clinic node and end node at the very end any more
Note4: 2. if clinic has multiple choice, I want it to be this form:
      "question": "建議您就診：1. XXX科，2. XXX科。請選擇要前往的科別？",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "options": ["1", "2"],
      "next": {
        "1": "4_xxx_specialty",
        "2": "4_xxx_specialty"}
Note5: when the user have find the only subspecialty node, the node will always be like:
{
      "question": "建議科別：XXX科。需要我幫您找到最近的診所嗎？(1=是, 2=否)",
      "type": "yes_no",
      "meta": {
          "specialty": "(the abbreviation for the subspecialty)"
        },
      "nextIfYes": find_clinic
      "nextIfNo": end
    },
Note6: for the abbreviation for the subspecialties, follow the rules of, 
{ oph: Ophthalmology, er: Emergency, neuro: Neurology, fm: Family Medicine, derm: Dermatology,
rheum: Rheumatology, ent: Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT), ortho: Orthopedics, cm: Pulmonology, cv: Cardiology, 
gi: Gastroenterology, psy: Psychology, gs: Surgery, uro: Urology, nephro: Nephrology, crs: Colorectal Surgery,
obsgyn: Obsteric and gynecology, peds: pediatrics, hema: Hematology}
Note7: the question of the start node will always start with exactly the this string "您提到{{SYMPTOM}}", like following:
        "XXX_start": {
        "question": "您提到{{SYMPTOM}}...",
        ...
        }
Note8: give each node with a section "No", except for the node that has a section "meta" in it. Start with number after the flow_, follow by an underscore and the number of the node within the nodes.
Note9: give me a json file name to this flow at the start
Note10: Before find clinic node, add a get-gender node. The name follows pevious rules(the name is a number followed by get_gender) but the "No" of this node always 0_10 regardless of its sequence
